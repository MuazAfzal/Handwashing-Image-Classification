## Data-Driven Assignment – Image-Based Hand Washing Classification

# Overview

This project focuses on using a data-driven approach to classify hand-washing steps using images. The goal was to train a machine learning model that can recognise whether a hand-washing action is performed correctly based purely on visual information.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of labelled images representing different hand-washing steps. Each image was preprocessed to ensure consistent size and quality before being used for training and testing.

# Method
	•	Images were cleaned and resized for consistency
	•	Visual features were extracted from the images
	•	A supervised machine learning model was trained on the labelled data
	•	Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix

# Tools & Technologies
	•	Python
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	NumPy, Pandas
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	OpenCV / image processing libraries

Outcome

The final model was able to classify hand-washing steps with good accuracy, demonstrating how image data can be used effectively in a practical, real-world classification task.
